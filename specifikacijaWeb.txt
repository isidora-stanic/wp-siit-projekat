FUNCTIONALITIES
---------------
-Registration:
	- New user becomes a Buyer upon registration
	- Admins are loaded from a text file, and cannot be added later
	- Sellers are registered by an admin. Buyer cannot become a seller
-Logging in:
	- All registered users can see their profiles
	- All registered users can change their data
	- ADMINS can see all the registered users and their data
	- SELLERS can see all their manifestations, ticket reservations
	and the buyers that reserved their tickets

-Home page:
	- All visitors can see all the manifestations
	- Manifestation search on following criteria:
		>Name
		>Type
		>DateTime
		>Location
		>Poster (image, wtf)?
		>Price
		>Avg. rating
	- Search should also provide SORTING on the following criteria:
		>Name
		>Price
		>DateTime
		>Location
	- Search should also provide FILTERING on the following criteria:
		>Type
		>Display of non-sold-out manifestations
-Mainfestation page:
	- Should display all the manifestation info, comments, and rating
	- Should display a location map

-Sellers:
	- Can add new manifestations
	- When adding a manifestation, no other manifestation can be held
	at that time, at that place
		*This can be implemented by having a hash map of locations,
		Where each location has a list of times when they are busy
	- New manifestation has status Inactive. To become active ADMIN
	must approve it. This can be achieved by adding a field adminSeen
	in manifestation, and returning all that arent seen by admin
	- Sellers can change manifestation data

-Tickets:
	- All BUYERS can see all their tickets on their profile
	- All BUYERS can see all their reserved cards
	- BUYERS can search through their tickets on:
		-Manifestation name
		-Ticket price (within a given interval)
		-Date and Time (within a given time interval)
	- BUYERS can SORT their tickets on:
		-Manifestation name
		-Ticket price
		-Date time
	- BUYERS can FILTER their tickets on:
		-Ticket type
		-Ticket status
	- SELLERS can see all the reserved ticets
	- ADMINS can see all the tickets
	- FAN_PIT_PRICE = 2 * REGULAR_PRICE
	  VIP_PRICE = 4 * REGULAR_PRICE
	- Only BUYERS can reserve tickets
	- BUYERS can reserve one or more tickets
	- When BUYERS reserve a card they get loyalty points:
		point_no = (total_price/1000)*133
	- BUYERS can cancel reservations 7 days before the manifestation
	- If BUYERS cancel a reservations they lose points:
		point_no = (ticket_price/1000)*133*4

-Comments:
	- BUYERS that reserved a ticket for a manifestation can leave
	a comment on the manifestation, AFTER it has finished
	- Buyers can see comments that have been approved by the SELLER
	- SELLERS and ADMINS can see all the comments

-Users:
	- ADMIN can see all the users
	- ADMIN can search all the users by:
		>Name
		>Surname
		>Username
	- ADMIN can sort all the users by:
		>Name
		>Surname
		>Username
		>No. of loyalty points
	- ADMIN can filter all the users by:
		>Role
		>Type 
	- ADMIN can see sketchy users (if they have more than 5 cancelations
	in the last month)
	- ADMIN can block registered users (This seems the same as deleting)
-Search:
	- Everybody should search on multiple criteria at once??
